Project Title: AI-Powered Food Waste Reduction and Donation System

Project Description:

Food waste is a major global issue, with tons of edible food discarded daily. This project leverages machine learning and predictive analytics to minimize food waste and promote responsible food donation. The system helps restaurants, supermarkets, and households track food inventory, predict spoilage, and suggest donation options before food expires.

Project Workflow:
	1.	Data Collection & Preprocessing:
	•	A dataset of food items, expiry dates, consumption patterns, and storage conditions is collected.
	•	Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature extraction (nutritional value, shelf life), and normalization.
	2.	Machine Learning Model Implementation:
	•	Predictive Analytics: A Time Series Forecasting Model (LSTM, ARIMA, or XGBoost) predicts food spoilage based on historical data, temperature, and storage conditions.
	•	Image Classification: A CNN-based model (ResNet or MobileNet) analyzes food images to detect spoilage signs (e.g., color changes, mold).
	•	Recommendation System: Uses collaborative filtering (SVD, KNN) to match surplus food with nearby donation centers, food banks, or needy communities.
	3.	Web & Mobile Application Development:
	•	A user-friendly web and mobile app is built using Flask/Django for the backend and React Native/Flutter for the frontend.
	•	Users can log food inventory, receive spoilage alerts, and find nearby donation centers.
	4.	Deployment & Integration:
	•	The model is deployed using TensorFlow Serving or FastAPI.
	•	Cloud storage (AWS S3, Firebase) is used for food images and inventory data.
	•	Google Maps API helps locate food banks and charities for donation.

Tools & Technologies Used:
	•	Machine Learning & AI: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV
	•	Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Backend: Flask, Django, FastAPI
	•	Frontend: React, Flutter, HTML/CSS
	•	Database: PostgreSQL, Firebase, MongoDB
	•	Deployment: AWS, Google Cloud, Docker

Why This Project?
	•	Promotes Social Responsibility: Reduces food waste and supports food donation initiatives.
	•	Applies Advanced ML Techniques: Uses predictive analytics, deep learning, and recommendation systems.
	•	Real-World Impact: Helps businesses and individuals optimize food usage, benefiting both the environment and underprivileged communities.
	•	Showcases Technical Expertise: Demonstrates data science, machine learning model development, cloud deployment, and app integration.

This project is a perfect addition to your resume, highlighting both technical proficiency and a strong commitment to social responsibility.
